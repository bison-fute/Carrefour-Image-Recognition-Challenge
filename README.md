# Carrefour Image Recognition Challenge

**Tips :**  <br/>
To speed up the learning process, put num_worker=4 if you have 4 cores on your machine, turn it to 0 if it does not work with your material.  <br/>
Depending on your linux or windows distro, string splitting with "\\" might or might not work, if it does not work, replace it with "/" and vice-versa.  <br/>

**Content :**  <br/>
File metadata-processing.py : <br/>
a class MetadataPreprocessing : set metadata into a class, convert json to a list of dict, show what describes the key 'arbonodes', focus on the branch of is_primary_link of all products. Modify the json file removing is_primary_link = False fields. <br/>
File sujet.pdf : les slides données au début du challenge. <br/>
File sujet_precision_conf.pdf : les notes de la conférence, deuxième prise de vue. <br/>
Other python script such as main.py that triggers the learning process.  <br/>
